# notion2ical

This project is unlikely to ever get finished - I am no longer using Notion in a way that would find a calendar export useful. I'm leaving this up here, as it's 50% done - it can successfully publish a Cloudflare Worker which will fetch events from a single Notion calendar and publish them as ical which can be imported into Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.
